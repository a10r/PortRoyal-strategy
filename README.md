# Port Royal strategy

Port Royal is a 2-5 player card game published by Pegasus Games. While playing, I noticed that some basic strategies seemed to be more successful than others.

This project contains a model of the game and a simulation engine that can be used for (statistically) evaluating the winning chances of different strategies.

This project is NOT a playable (video) game.

Part of the goal of this project was also to find out how well suited non-trivial immutable data structures are for simulations (in terms of performance).
